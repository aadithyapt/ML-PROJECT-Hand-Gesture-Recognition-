# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a robust **Hand Gesture Recognition** system using traditional Machine Learning techniques. The model accurately identifies and classifies various hand gestures from image inputs, aiming to improve **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and inspire use cases in fields like assistive tech, robotics, AR/VR, and more.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🖐️ **Gesture Classification** — Recognizes multiple hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, palm, fist).
- 📷 **Image/Frame Processing** — Extracts hand landmarks and features for classification.
- 🤖 **ML Model** — Trained with Scikit-learn classifiers (e.g., SVM, KNN, Random Forest).
- 📈 **High Accuracy** — Achieved strong performance across test data using optimized features.
- 💡 **Use Case Ready** — Can be extended for virtual controllers, sign language interpretation, and gesture-based UIs.
